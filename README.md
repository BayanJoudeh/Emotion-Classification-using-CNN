Face Expression Recognition

Overview

This project builds a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify facial expressions from images. The dataset used is the Face Expression Recognition Dataset, which consists of grayscale images of faces with different emotions.

Dataset

The dataset is structured as follows:

Train Directory: Contains images for training categorized into different emotion classes.

Validation Directory: Contains images for model validation.

The dataset can be found at: Kaggle Face Expression Recognition Dataset

Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries installed:
 pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn keras tensorflow
